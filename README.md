# Search_and_verify
Searching for only texts with properly documented sources.

So much junk is available on the internet.  And while we have great resources available, like some articles with clear and well documented citations from Wikipedia, so much is unverfied, mislabeled, not cited.  I am aiming here to create a simple word search to return relevant quotes from a text body.

## Process

Using python and begining with some available libraries in ntlk, I will start with making a word search that returns a full sentence.  Once complete the project will be reevaluated and next steps clarified.
